working on right now: 

need to fix the grass (will do this first) (done)

next, need to incorporate the path finding code into it (done)

next, make 3v10 of the code. 
-incorporate the grass and it's squares. 
-make it so that the character cannot walk into rocks, or 
go past the border. 
-implement the code so that the character will
follow a given path. 
-incorporate the path finding algorithm. 


will then implement chat box.

also need to finish up gui for user. said gui will include 2 bars:

top one (scrollable, left and right) of characters you currently control (just shows characters name).

bar on bottom: picture of character, his health, current gun, current armor (armor will just
be a button, that opens a box that tells you the stats of every piece of it, as well as type 'i.e.
"heavy", "medium", "light'). 

next to armor button will be a phrase like: 'great','good','okay','bad','almost gone' that will 
represent the average condition of the armor.
