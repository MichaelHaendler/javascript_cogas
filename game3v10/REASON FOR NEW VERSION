3v10

with this version, I, at the very least, will: 

be able to click at one spot, and have my character walk there. 

will have grass, rocks, and possibly buildings. 

might also do the other stuff. including: 

user gui 

bad guys 

dialouge. 

3v9

doing a new version because I have to fix the issues of the color square remaining in the 
stuff_box instance even after I take out the item, and also have to fix the issue of the
items not really being draggable after I put an item into the stuff_box instance.

LOL! well...holy shit. better lucky than smart. Apparently the error with the item not
really being draggable stemed from my new display items code. found out by accident. totally
happy about the results. 

that shit is working. 

I needed it to do rule 2 

the yellow box needs to be fixed. and so does the button. and the invisible box for the inventory
rect. 

those 3 things will be done after rule 2. 

notes and general writings: 

give man an instance of menu. 

have that working. (should)

--man has location on screen

--pass that (and w and h) to menu 

--menu passes that to inventory_rect 

--inventory_rect passes that to an item any time 
rule 2 is called 

-------------------------

put in w and h into person 

pass those values to menu

menu to rect

rect to square whenever rule 2 (for where to post item)
