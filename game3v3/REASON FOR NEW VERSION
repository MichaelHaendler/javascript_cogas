this version will have a bunch of files missing from it (that are in 3v2) that I had created
specifically for building a detectable object. LOL...still have the same issue
that I was having before about not detecting the object properly (areas that
should be seen as part of the obj aren't, and areas that shouldn't be seen as 
part of the obj, are).  

it will also be the version where I will be building the inventory, and
perhaps even the user interface.
