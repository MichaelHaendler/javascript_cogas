3v3
this version will have a bunch of files missing from it (that are in 3v2) that I had created
specifically for building a detectable object. LOL...still have the same issue
that I was having before about not detecting the object properly (areas that
should be seen as part of the obj aren't, and areas that shouldn't be seen as 
part of the obj, are).  

it will also be the version where I will be building the inventory, and
perhaps even the user interface. 

3v4

so I actually got stuff_box working in 3v3. I'm so stoked about that, that I'm making this new version
just in case I fuck something up and want to easily be able to go back and get my original 
version of it. 

didn't do user interface or inventory in it or anything. I just got stuff_box working and have
the (seemingly) fully working item. have an issue with getting stuff_box to detect items coming
in front the right side of it. Not a huge issue though (everything else seems to work)
