okay...

so when I do a character/person. 

I take the sheet, then select a section of it, and post it onto the general
canvas. 

what I want to do, is take the sheet, take the size of it, assign it to a variable, and
then use that variable to post the image to the general canvas.

to take things a step further, I want to just make the element on the fly, assign to 
a variable, and then post to general canvas. 

1) manually make canvas that you can call and that has all the properties you want. post
that to a canvas. 

2) manually make canvas that you can call and that has all the properties you want. assign
it to a variable and post that to a canvas. 

3) make canvas on the fly, assign to variable, post to canvas.


-------------------------

current idea

build your canvas with the object picture on it (some sub section of a set of images or w/e), return that. 

build your square (a section of a gray area?), post the image on that, return it. 

take the square with the image on it (100% of it), and past that to the rectangle. 

need to go back and test these things one at a time methinks 

probably, build the canvas in the object, take the section of image, post image to that, and return that. 

build the canvas for the square, get the object canvas as well, post 100% of that to the square, then 
return the results 

finally take the general canvas, post the square with the object in it to the canvas. 

NOW....how to deal with this new object? 

lol okay. array. each object that needs to be displayed gets put into it. for loop and print it to
the screen. get the dimenion stuff (if needed) from the object itself. 

the basic idea is going to have to be done anyway. Later on something more advanced will probably
be needed. 

going to have to work on button, object, and stuff_box to get this stuff working. 


lol fuck it. start with gen object and the new canvas idea. 

actually, no. 

create a new (small) canvas, and draw it to the current canvas. 

then try drawing a small thingy to that small canvas, and then take
that small canvas with the thingy drawn to it, and draw that to the 
general canvas. 

then you're set. 

gonna also need that array and method (should be pretty simple actually).

=================================================

array that stores all the items to be displayed. 

item gets put into the array. then when array is ran it simply

-iterates through all of the items, taking each item, and displaying it.
