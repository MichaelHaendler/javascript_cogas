my new print 2d array tool seems to be working. going to delete all the old ones. 

that will take 2 seconds. 

the big thing that I am doing is: 

correcting it so that the adj_x and adj_y vals in terr square's get_ascii_terrain_block_type
method are calculated correctly. 

displaying those values in the correct location on the ascii diagram

note: need to make sure that the tb's are being set properly. 

lol okay.
