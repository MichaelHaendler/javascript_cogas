so what's the idea here? 

lol I think I kinda want to redo some stuff to a degree. 

so what do I want to do? 

okay okay I think I have this. 

I will be making a new folder soon to fuck around with terrain square. 

new ideas: 

lol a lot to do. 

fix the w,h,l stuff. 

a rock has the width of one tb. has the length of 3 tbs. has the height of 3 tbs. 

a layer of grass has the width of 3 tbs. has the length of 3 tbs. has the height of 0
tbs (or is it 1? I'm not sure).

only one method for setting up terrain square (though that note is for terrain layer)

need to get the red and blue squares working on the rock. 

rock (and really everything else) will only be defined by it's base. rock will be 1 row
(of 3 tbs) long, and all together 3 rows high. thats all you should see of it on the print
out. 

and finally, on that note, need to set up the new format for barrier. from now on, barrier
will be initiated along with the instantiation of a terrain square. though it will be its
own method (not just some free floating code in the constructor).
