(think this is already basically done. need to deal with the 3d layers
though)
-get terr square work (with block). make sure it's dynamic in its
width and height (size needs to be in terms of terr blocks though)


-terrain layer: is made up of terr blocks which is then filled with
terr squares. not every terr block will actually be filled. will use
for-in for this 

-terrain holder (displaying ground)

grass, rocks, etc need only inserted into ascii 3d array once

-area_controller (displays everything), and says what part to display

--character_controller
has to keep up with all of the characters. which one is clicked on, which
ones are where, etc. you initiate a character and insert it into 
character_controller. 

--ground_object_controller
keep up with all of the objects on the ground

--area_displayer
what part of the ground to display

implement these 3 parts, and combine them all into area_controller. 

-------------------------

today: 

will make sure that the square are being added properly to terrain_layer

also need to make sure that rock is being added properly to it. 

grass is at layer 0. 

person walks ontop of grass. thus layer 1 

rock is sitting ontop of grass...thus layer 1 :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------

terr square already works

need to get layer working. 

grass is layer 0 and is set to zero 

it is set to a specific t-block in the tba of terr layer. lots of blanks. 
will use for in to go through them. 

HOWEVER

with ascii tba, ...it will fill in its proper location. 


so make modifications to terr layer 

as for rocks, that stuff is going to have to be manually done. because it all
depends on how that stuff is drawn.  

----------------------

this version I will hopefully get the pseudo 3d stuff working.

I think (maybe) verion 4 is where I will correct the width/length/height stuff. 

after that...I dunno. getting the character into there I guess.  

--------------

/*
idea: 

first, get the two layers working (the grass and the one rock)

get it so that a person could walk behind, in front of, and to the sides
of the rock, but not through the rock. 

actually test this with a person character. 

after that, work on only the layer that the character is on being shown.
