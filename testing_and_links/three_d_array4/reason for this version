reason for version 4 is to make boundary area 3d. 

for rock for instance, instead of being 

[1,1,1] or whatever it is, will now be something like 

//d_array == double array. sometimes you might be dealing with something
//that you want to define for more than just 1 row at a time. 

var ba = [
{layer: 0, start_loc: [0,2], row_vals: [1,1,1], d_array: false},
{layer: 1, start_loc: [0,2], row_vals: [1,1,1], d_array: false},
{layer: 2, start_loc: [0,2], row_vals: [1,1,1], d_array: false}
];

could also be something though like: (this isn't right yet...but the
idea is on track)

[
{layer: 0, start_loc: [0,2], row_vals: 
[
[1,1,1],
[1,1,1],
[1,1,1]]},

{layer: 0, start_loc: [0,2], row_vals: 
[
[1,1,1],
[0,0,0],
[1,1,1]]},

{layer: 0, start_loc: [0,2], row_vals: 
[
[1,1,1],
[1,1,1],
[1,1,1]]}
]

where in that second layer, with the zeros, is a hole that could
be shot through. so your character could be on one side, and he sees
the enemy on the other side, and then shoots through the hole and hurts/kills
the enemy. :-) 


note: to do in version 4 

implement your new design. Will be cool because 
it will allow for a lot more control over stationary objects that
are in the way of the character

then get rid of type. just have default type be 0.
